To run the application you should prepare your database:
1) Cleanup the database:
	- connect to local mongo
	- check existing databases:
		show dbs
	- select required for the application:
		use expert_evaluation
	- check existing collections in chosen DB:
		show collections
	- if collections used in the app already exist in your MongoDB,
	  please make sure that their structure corresponds to the last version of structure
	  required for the application - find documents in your database and compare them with 
	  ones that can be found below
	- if your development database is not up to date, cleanup it:
		db.questions.remove({}) - this will remove all documents from 
	  "questions" collection. repeat the same for all other collections that don't match 
	  the structure
	- insert testing data to the collections in the db so that it matches the folowing
		Note! 1. pay attention to naming - capital letters matter
			  2. you don't have to insert "_id" parameter - it's auto-generated 
			  3. RightAnswer is an array, nevertheless it contains only one element in the examples
			  4. QuestionType represent index of values from the enum QuestionType (index of QuestionType.BooleanQuestion is 0)
		sequences:
			> db.sequences.find({}).pretty()
			{
					"_id" : ObjectId("5340077f687538854352ecc5"),
					"Value" : 1,
					"Name" : "questions"
			}
			{
					"_id" : ObjectId("53400785687538854352ecc6"),
					"Name" : "users",
					"Value" : 1
			}
		questions:
			> db.questions.find({}).pretty()
			{
					"_id" : ObjectId("5339caf587cd9bf2739c8136"),
					"QuestionNumber" : 1,
					"QuestionText" : "Who are piglets?",
					"QuestionType" : 1,
					"PossibleAnswers" : [
							"Big bugs",
							"Small dogs",
							"Big pigs",
							"Small pigs"
					],
					"RightAnswers" : [
							"Small pigs"
					]
			}
			{
					"_id" : ObjectId("534007f1da98fa15080c1967"),
					"QuestionNumber" : 5,
					"QuestionText" : "Fifth one",
					"QuestionType" : 0,
					"PossibleAnswers" : [
							"True",
							"False"
					],
					"RightAnswers" : [
							"False"
					]
			}
