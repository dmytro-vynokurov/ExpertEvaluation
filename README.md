================

It's educational project to be shown at the university
Developed by Dmytro Vynokurov and Maryna Popova

Another goal of the project is to try using MongoDB from C#
and remind myself how to develop Windows Forms application

There is a lot of bad code in it - custom sequences for database,
hardcoded strings (connection parameters etc), code cannot be modified 
to run in a multithreaded environment etc.

However, it seems to be ok for studying purposes considering the lack
of time for it's development
